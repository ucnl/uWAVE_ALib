# uWAVE_ALib
Arduino library for working with [uWave underwater acoustic modems](https://docs.unavlab.com/underwater_acoustic_modems_en.html#uwave)

## Examples

### Example 1
[All in one](https://github.com/ucnl/uWAVE_ALib/blob/main/examples/uWAVE_ALib_example_1.ino)  
This sketch demonstrates almost all basic usage techniques for uWave modems with translating all queries and results to Ardiono console (via Arduino port monitor)

### Example 2
[Controlling Arduino pins remotely](https://github.com/ucnl/uWAVE_ALib/blob/main/examples/uWAVE_ALib_RemoteControl.ino)  
This sketch allows you to use uWave's [user commands](https://docs.unavlab.com/documentation/EN/uWAVE/uWAVE_Protocol_Specification_en.html#42-remote-commands) to control 9 arduino pins remotely.
